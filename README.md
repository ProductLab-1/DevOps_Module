## DevOps Module

Welcome to the DevOps Module of ProductLab. Building on the foundation laid in the Quality Assurance Module, it's time to dive deeper into the world of software development processes. DevOps, an essential complement to QA, focuses on the continuous delivery and integration of software, ensuring that your team can efficiently ship code while maintaining quality and security. As a Product Manager, understanding DevOps is crucial to overseeing a smooth, efficient, and secure software deployment process.

### Housekeeping

Make sure to "watch" the repo for this module, just as you did with the QA module. This practice is essential for keeping track of participation and ensuring you're up-to-date with all updates.
